# RsyncVolumes

Use rsync with caution. Use this script with even more caution. Read the man page.

Actual options may vary between versions of rsync.

Path to binary varies with source, whether Apple supplied, installed by Mac Ports, or externally downloaded binary.

Remove "--dryrun" option when you're satisfied that rsync and this script are doing what you want. 

Never use rsync with real data without a proper backup.
